My name is Ayaan, im 18 years old currently studying cyber security in University, I enjoy doing programming and learning about it as it lets me gain skills not many people have but also this skill will help me in the future with my career, giving me a variety of options so I can decide what field I want to get invovled in carving a clear path for me in the future as its giving me the neccessary knowledge for me to become successful in the future. But there still is a lot to learn yet as I'm new to this, so I'm going to concentrate ensuring I manage to do something with the skills I will hopefully eventually gain.
